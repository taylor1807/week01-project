# week01-project

i had issues trying to get my position absolute working correctly, it kept overlapping each other all on the 1st page, towards the end of the class others posted theres and it was the same as mine but working, i overcame it by creating an additional container div and setting as relative. Not sure though how it didn't work.

i did have a play with the return to top button where i read a guide on w3schools and implemented, it being something we have'nt covered yet i don't have the understanding of it but it works :)
