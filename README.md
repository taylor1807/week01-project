i had issues trying to get my position absolute working correctly, it kept overlapping each other all on the 1st page, towards the end of the class others posted theres and it was the same as mine but working, i overcame it by creating an additional container div and setting as relative. Not sure though how it didn't work.

i did have a play with the return to top button where i read a guide on w3schools and implemented, it being something we have'nt covered yet i don't have the understanding of it but it works :)

other sections i got on ok with, i did change clickable anchors for buttons to see if i could achieve an anchor on a button

the audio is from doom 2016 it is purchased by me (came with the game) only thing i think of on my pc which hopefully shouldn't need to worry about a license, so doesnt really fit the theme but i wanted to attach the audio :)
